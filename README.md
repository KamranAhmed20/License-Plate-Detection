# License Plate Recognition (LPR) and Verification System using YOLOv8 and EasyOCR

---
#### An end-to-end AI-based system for automatic vehicle license plate detection, recognition, and verification from video feeds. This project combines the power of **YOLOv8**, **EasyOCR**, and **OpenCV** to offer a scalable solution for intelligent traffic monitoring and smart law enforcement systems.
---

##  How to Setup

- Upload everything to Google Drive
- Open file1.py through Google Colab (The cells will show the current output, if you want to check it with your video, then follow step 03)
- Change the paths in the file according to your own drive (Sample.mp4, Dataset Paths, CSV Paths, etc)
- just run all the cells.
- Enjoy :)

##  Motivation

As urban areas face increasing vehicle traffic, there's a rising need for **automated, intelligent traffic systems**. While many LPR systems focus on detection or text recognition alone, our work bridges this gap with an **integrated verification mechanism** â€” simulating real-world applications such as:
- Identifying unregistered vehicles (number plate valid or not)
- Verifying ownership (owner's license information against that registered vehicle)
- Suppose a traffic camera can instantly detect a stolen flagged vehicle and inform the traffic authorities accross different cities.

##  Project Workflow

### Step-by-Step Pipeline:
See the complete workflow attached after these steps for detailed understanding.

1. **Video Frame Extraction**  
   - Video input is split into individual frames using OpenCV.
   - Ensures frame-by-frame analysis in real-time simulation.

2. **Vehicle Detection using YOLOv8**  
   - A pre-trained YOLOv8 nano model (`yolov8n.pt`) detects cars in frames.

3. **License Plate Detection**  
   - Another pre-trained model (`license_plate_detector.pt`) is used to extract plates from detected vehicles.

4. **Text Extraction using EasyOCR**  
   - Extracted license plates are cropped and passed through EasyOCR to retrieve alphanumeric data.

5. **Database Matching for Verification**  
   - Extracted plate numbers are normalized and checked against a custom database (containing mock data like owner name, registration status, etc.)
   - Simulates use cases like real-time verification through official government APIs (e.g., NADRA, ETO).

- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib** â€“ Data processing and visualization

---

##  Key Features

- Real-time processing simulation on video streams
- Modular and scalable pipeline
- Cropped license plate images and annotated frames as output
- End-to-end license plate detection + recognition + verification
- Proof-of-concept for smart traffic and law enforcement applications

---

##  Sample Outputs

- âœ… Annotated video frames with detected vehicles and plates
- âœ… Cropped license plate images saved to `extracted_ocr_plates/`
- âœ… CSV files containing extracted and verified license plate numbers

---

##  Research Contribution (What makes it different from any other LPR)

This project highlights:
- A **complete LPR system**, not just isolated detection or OCR
- Simulated integration with a **vehicle registry database**, here its only demonstrated but could be impactful if implemented with governmental databases, (Same context has been conveyed in our unpublished Research Paper)
- Application in **real-world domains** like smart cities, traffic law enforcement, and stolen vehicle identification

Our **research paper** provides a detailed breakdown of this systemâ€™s performance, design choices, and integration potential.

---

##  Future Scope

- Integration with live traffic CCTV feeds
- Connection to real government APIs (e.g., NADRA, Excise Department)
- Inclusion of other detection modules (e.g., helmet detection, seatbelt tracking)
